# PROJECT CONTEXT & HISTORY

## Project Overview
**Name**: HyperTips / ProTips
**Description**: A sports betting tips web application providing daily "AI-analyzed" opportunities, super odds, and history tracking.
**Tech Stack**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS, Python (updater script).

## Current State (As of 2026-01-23)
- **Rebranding**: The app has been rebranded from "SuperTips" to "ProTips" / "HyperTips".
- **Affiliate Link**: The main CTA link is configured to `https://brsuperbet.com/registro_4903`.
- **Key Features**:
  - Live game feed (simulated or fetched via `updater.py` from ESPN).
  - "Super Odds" filter.
  - History view (Last 7 days).
  - Onboarding modal for new users (verifies age + "new account").
  - "Smart Pop-ups" for bet reminders.

## Key Files
- `index.html`: Main entry point structure.
- `app.js`: Core frontend logic, state management, rendering (feed, history, highlight), and affiliate link handling.
- `games_data.js`: JSON data dump generated by Python.
- `updater.py`: Python script that fetches real data from ESPN, applies "AI" logic simulation, and generates `games_data.js`.

## Recent Changes
1. **Affiliate Link Update**: Updated `state.affiliateLink` in `app.js` to `https://brsuperbet.com/registro_4903`.
2. **Folder Sync**: Ensured changes are applied to both `App tips` and `App-tips` directories.

## Instructions for Future Agents
- **ALWAYS** read this file first to understand the context.
- When updating the app, ensure `updater.py` logic is preserved (it handles the "AI" analysis generation).
- Maintain the "Clinical/Premium" aesthetic.
