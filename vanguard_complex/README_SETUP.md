# Vanguard Project - Setup Guide

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Initialization

This guide details how to boot the Vanguard system generated by the Agent.

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Docker Desktop** (Running)
- **Flutter SDK** (3.16+)
- **Python** (3.12+) [Optional if using Docker]

### 2. Backend & Infrastructure (Docker)
Run the following command in the root directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located):

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

**Verify Status:**
Access `http://localhost:8000/health` in your browser. You should see a JSON response confirming "operational".

### 3. Frontend (Flutter)
Since the files were generated in a skeleton state, you need to initialize the Flutter project context:

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Initialize new project (if not exists) or get dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Initialize (if folder was empty, but files exist now so run carefully or use 'flutter create .')
   flutter create . --org com.vanguard --project-name vanguard_app
   
   # Add critical dependencies
   flutter pub add google_fonts go_router flutter_web_plugins
   
   # Get all packages
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the App:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome  # For Web Preview
   # OR
   flutter run -d emulator-5554 # For Android Emulator
   ```

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
Once valid screenshot is confirmed, we will proceed to "The Data Engine" (Odds Ingestion).
